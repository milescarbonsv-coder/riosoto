        "content": "At RioSoto, we don't stay in the past. With 80 years of history, we know that to continue being the flavor that unites us, we need to look ahead.

It means more jobs, more growth, and the commitment of a family company that from El Salvador continues reinvesting in its people and expanding to Honduras, Guatemala, and all of Central America. While many look elsewhere, we keep betting on our region.\n\nWe've spent 80 years preparing every ice cream and every popsicle with dedication. Now, with Tetra Pak technology backing us, we assure you that the next 80 years are going to be even fresher.\n\nThank you for continuing to choose us. This is just the beginning.\n\n---\n\n*RioSoto — The flavor that unites us.*"
